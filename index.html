<p>Thanks for visiting my repo, it's kind of a work in progress...</p>
<p>i.e. perpetually a work in progress...</p>
<p>I am a full stack software engineer living and working in Seattle, WA.  I am passionate about highly performant apps, and love working in audio, video, and crypto applications.</p>
<p>I work on iOS, Android, and IoT applications and the cloud based services they consume.</p>

<h2 id="primary-programming-languages">Primary Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Swift</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have worked with Swift since it's was first publicly available.  I am also familiar with the swift compiler, package manager, and lldb implementation at a source code level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Objective-C</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I began working with Objective-C before the release of iOS, and as a result I have been working with iOS since it's first release. I published a number of early articles on how to do TDD with iOS/X-Code, how to consume services, and general coding guidelines for companies starting with Objective-C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>C/C++</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have worked with C and C++ throughout my career.
Early on I worked with high-capacity distributed and computational systems utilizing C++ and big metal assembly languages like PA-RISC, later with dynamically discoverable late bound distributed services in the same fashion.  Now though, most of my C++ work is when working with LLDB/LLVM/Clang extensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am relatively new to Go, I have been working with it for just about two years now.  I am very familiar with and I am a big fan of the go/docker pairing for quickly standing up services for mobile clients to consume.
I have workd with both Redis and Dynamo as persistence stores, I am familiar with the proper use of channels, debugging using dlv, and TDD using a number of test frameworks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Python</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually became more proficient at Python by teaching it to my kids, then when I discovered what an be done with LLDB and Python, I was hooked.  Now I use it as my goto scripting language for most things unless there is a specific reason not to.</p>
